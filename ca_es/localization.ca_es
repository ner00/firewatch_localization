Could you do me a favor and please return them to me Brian Goodwin in the mail. My address is 55 Foxtrot Lane North Platte Nebraska 69101. If you tell me your name and address I will give you a reward for this. You are probably wondering why I left these here.  Well they are my dads and I don’t want him to lose them but I dont want to do any more climbing on this trip so I thought I should pretend to lose them. But if you help me get them back everyone will be happy. Thank You for your time.\r\n\r\nThank You Ranger,\r\n\r\nBrian\r\n\r\nP.S.: The reward will be good.": "Benvolgut guardaboscs,\n\nEl meu nom és Brian Goodwin. Si ha trobat aquesta nota,  hauria d'estar al costat d'un munt de ancoratges d'escalada, espero. Em podria fer un favor i tornar-me'ls a mi, en Brian Goodwin, per correu. La meva adreça és Foxtrot Lane, 55,  North Platte, Nebraska, 69101- Segurament s'estarà preguntant perquè he deixat aquestes coses aquí.  Bé, són del meu pare i no vull que els perdi però tampoc vull fer més escalada durant aquest viatgi així que he pensat que el millor era fingir que els havia perdut. Però si vostè m'ajuda i els retorna tothom estarà content. Gràcies pel seu temps.\n\nGràcies guardabosc,\n\nBrian\n\nP.S.",

You would probably think I was a liar but you would be wrong. Meteors, the alien rocks that come to our planet from outer space, can be used, to bounce HAM Radio waves off of and let you use your radio much better than normal.  Right now you are thinking OK Brian, this sounds like a movie, like Flight Of The Navigator, its not real. But you are wrong, it is real, it is science.\r\n\r\n\tIt is possible because of Meteor Scatter Communications. My Science Fair Project proves that Meteor Scatter Communications is real. But what it is?  MSC is a radio propagation mode that utilizes the ionized trails of meteors within our atmosphere. Meteors, upon their atmospheric entry, can create a dense path of ionized particles that the HAM radio operator can use to establish brief communications paths between operators up to 1’500 miles away. Its pretty cool.\r\n\r\n\tI am going to test this by having a small chat with a friend my dad made in the Army who lives in Albuquerque New Mexico, one thousand miles from my house.
