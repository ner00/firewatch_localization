You would probably think I was a liar but you would be wrong. Meteors, the alien rocks that come to our planet from outer space, can be used, to bounce HAM Radio waves off of and let you use your radio much better than normal.  Right now you are thinking OK Brian, this sounds like a movie, like Flight Of The Navigator, its not real. But you are wrong, it is real, it is science.\r\n\r\n\tIt is possible because of Meteor Scatter Communications. My Science Fair Project proves that Meteor Scatter Communications is real. But what it is?  MSC is a radio propagation mode that utilizes the ionized trails of meteors within our atmosphere. Meteors, upon their atmospheric entry, can create a dense path of ionized particles that the HAM radio operator can use to establish brief communications paths between operators up to 1’500 miles away. Its pretty cool.\r\n\r\n\tI am going to test this by having a small chat with a friend my dad made in the Army who lives in Albuquerque New Mexico, one thousand miles from my house. We are going to try to talk at a regular time but my hypothesis is that that won’t work and we will have to wait for a meteor shower so we can establish a communication-\r\n": "Brian Goodwin\r\nHamilton Science Fair\r\nRough Draft\r\nMrs. McNamara 6th Grade\r\nApril 4, 1986\r\n\r\nTALKING METEORS! \r\nHow HAM Radio Waves Can Use Meteors to Talk to People Far Away\r\n\r\n\tWhat if I told you that you could you use meteors in our atmosphere to talk to people far away.
