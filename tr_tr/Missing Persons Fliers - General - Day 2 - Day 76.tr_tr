  "Henry": "Henry",
  "How many hikers go missing in the Shoshone?": "Shoshone'da ne kadar yürüyüşçü kayboluyor?",
  "Delilah": "Delilah",
  "More than none, unfortunately. With most of them being in this area, the Thorofare, because it's so remote. Why?": "More than none, unfortunately. With most of them being in this area, the Thorofare, because it's so remote. Why?",
  "Why? You hoping these girls didn't make it back to the trailhead? Because that's a little dark, Hank.": "Why? You hoping these girls didn't make it back to the trailhead? Because that's a little dark, Hank.",
  "Why? You don't think you're going to end up on a milk carton, do you?": "Neden? Sonunun kayıp ilanları kutularının üstünde geleceğini düşünmüyorsun, değil mi?",
  "I found an old flyer for a missing hiker. It just got me thinking, that's all.": "Kayıp yürüyüşçüyle ilgili bir el ilanı buldum. Aklımdan geçmedi de değil, hepsi bu.",
  "Like how you said one day you were talking to the Goodwins and the next you weren't.": "Sen de söyledin bir gün Goodwinlerle konuşuyordun ama ertesi gün konuşamadın.",
  "Ned Goodwin didn't get mauled by a bear or stuck in a ravine. He was just a PTSD'd a-hole who dragged his son out to do a job and realized it was a bad idea.": "Ned Goodwin bir ayı saldırısında parçalanmadı veya bir dağ geçidinde sıkışmadı. O, çocuğunu kendisiyle birlikte işe götüren ama sonra bunun bir hata olduğunun farkına varan TSSB'na sahip g-tün tekiydi.",
  "Eh, I probably shouldn't give that guy such a hard time. He just really rubbed me the wrong way.": "Eh, I probably shouldn't give that guy such a hard time. He just really rubbed me the wrong way.",
  "So…": "Yani...",
  "You sure a grizz didn't eat the Goodwins?": "Bir ayının Goodwins'i yemediğinden emin misin?",
  "What, grizzlies won't kill an a-hole? They don't have a taste for unapologetic pricks?": "Ne, bozayılar g-tleri öldürmüyor mu? Mazeret bulan şerefsizlerin tadını beğenmiyorlar mı?",
  "Grizzlies won't kill a-holes?": "Bozayılar g-tleri öldürmüyor mu?",
  "Nope. It's why we haven't lost a ranger in eleven years.": "Nope. It's why we haven't lost a ranger in eleven years.",
  "So you don't think anything bad happened to those guys?": "Yani bu adamlara kötü bir şey olduğunu düşünmüyorsun?",
  "I guess it's possible but we usually find evidence of stuff like that.": "I guess it's possible but we usually find evidence of stuff like that.",
  "For instance, if you were to be hunted down and torn to shreds I'm sure someone would come across a bloody beard and shredded pair of ugly cargo shorts.": "For instance, if you were to be hunted down and torn to shreds I'm sure someone would come across a bloody beard and shredded pair of ugly cargo shorts.",
  "I like these shorts.": "Bu şortları severim.",
  "I'm sure you do, Henry.": "Yapabileceğinden eminim, Henry.",
  "PTSD? That doesn't sound good.": "TSSB? Kulağa hiç hoş gelmiyor.",
  "Eh, I don't know. He was in the Army. He was… off. It's actually the saddest story. He was only discharged because his mother, Brian's grandmother, died. She'd been taking care of him and Ned was the only next of kin.": "Eh, Bilemiyorum. Ordu görevliydi. O... bıraktı. Aslında bu oldukça üzücü bir hikaye. Sadece annesi, Brian'ın büyükannesi, öldüğü için terhis edildi. Ona bakan kişi büyükkannesiydi ve Ned sahip olduğu tek akrabasıydı.",
  "Damn.  And you go to know Brian a little bit?": "Tüh. Sen de Brian'a biraz yakın olmaya çalıştın yani?",
  "Yeah. I talked to him way more than I talked to Ned, that's for sure.": "Aynen. Ned'le konuştuğumdan çok daha fazla onunla konuştum, bu kesin.",
  "How was he at, you know, spotting fires?": "Nasıldı peki, şeylerde, yangınları bildirmede?",
  "Better than you! He actually liked to stay in the tower.": "Senden daha iyiydi! Aslında kulede kalmayı çok seviyordu.",
  "Did you say PTSD?": "TSSB mi dedin sen?",
  "Isn't your radio supposed to be in the river?": "Isn't your radio supposed to be in the river?",
  "I couldn't bring myself to do it.": "I couldn't bring myself to do it.",
  "Well, I guess I'm stuck with you then.": "Well, I guess I'm stuck with you then.",
  "Yeah.": "Evet.",
  "So, did you mention something about Ned Goodwin having PTSD? That doesn't sound good.": "Ned Goodwin'in TSSB -Tramva Sonrası Stres Bozukluğu- geçirdiğini söyemiştin? Kulağa hiç hoş gelmiyor.",
  "You said Ned didn't get mauled by a grizzly but… it's possible right?": "You said Ned didn't get mauled by a grizzly but… it's possible right?",
  "You really didn't like that guy, did you?": "O adam hiç hoşuna gitmedi değil mi?",
  "You really didn't like that guy, huh?": "O adam hiç hoşuna gitmedi değil mi, huh?",
  "I don't know. I honestly… I just had a hard time talking to him. There are lookouts who seriously won't shut up, who call me about every little thing that pops into their head. And then there are those who just want to be left alone. He was the latter.": "I don't know. I honestly… I just had a hard time talking to him. There are lookouts who seriously won't shut up, who call me about every little thing that pops into their head. And then there are those who just want to be left alone. He was the latter.",
  "And I'm the former, aren't I?": "And I'm the former, aren't I?",
  "Well, I didn't want to say anything…": "Well, I didn't want to say anything…",
  "It's fine. I'll just chuck my walkie-talkie into the river.": "It's fine. I'll just chuck my walkie-talkie into the river.",
  "Heh, oh come on…": "Hı, hadi ama...",
  "And, uh, you'll never hear from me again.": "Ve, bir daha asla benden haber alamayacaksın.",
  "Finally, peace and quiet, woohoo!": "Sounda, barış ve sessizlik, vuuhuu!"
